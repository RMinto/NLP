- Question-answering system notebook shows how to build a question-answering system with search retrieval to interact with a knowledge base of 
documents using openai APIs. The function can be tweaked for general interactivity, not just question-answering but to interact with the 
document / knowledge base generally on top of gpt models, eg returning links along with answers.

- Chatbot fine-tuning notebook shows how easily we can fine-tune openai models with prompt-completion pairs
